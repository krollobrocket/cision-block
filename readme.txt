This plugin adds a shortcode and a widget that can be used for pulling and displaying pressreleases from cision.

== Description ==

This plugin is developed by [Cyclonecode](https://profiles.wordpress.org/cyclonecode) and can be used to load and expose press releases made by [Cision](http://www.cision.se/).

To start pulling feed items from cision you first need to add the unique identifier for you json feed at the configuration page for the plugin.
You can also change how many feed items to pull, type of feed items, enable pagination, configure caching and much more.

If you have questions or perhaps some idea on things that should be added you can also try [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cyclonecode/shared_invite/zt-6bdtbdab-n9QaMLM~exHP19zFDPN~AQ).

= Pro Version =

There is a **PRO** version of this plugin, which includes extended features. For instance:

★ Support to fetch entire feed and not only the last 100 entries.
★ Custom post types. Creates a post for each item in Wordpress. This means that all news have standard Wordpress links.
★ Manually created posts can be added to the feed.
★ Custom taxonomies for categories and tags fetched from Cision.
★ Use standard article template from your active theme.
★ Support to create, update and delete posts based on PUSH events sent from Cision.
★ Support to create, update and delete posts during CRON at configurable intervals.
★ Calendar module.
★ Cron module.
★ Insider module.
★ Link Back module.
★ Media module.
★ Share Graph module.
★ ShareHolder module.
★ Share Calculator module.
★ Subscription module.
★ Ticker module.
★ Translation module.
★ Use normal or ajax based load more button for pagination.
★ Annual free support and quicker response times.
★ Discount for multisite licenses.

I usually have an initial meeting where I talk about the plugin, explain the different features and answer any questions.

A demo site showing some of the modules can be found [here](https://dev-cision-block-pro.pantheonsite.io/).

To get more information about the Pro version, email me at [cisionblock@gmail.com](mailto:cisionblock@gmail.com) or give me a call at +(46)-767013987.

= Addons =

Even if you are not using the premium version of the plugin there is still possible to install addons for extended functionality.

Here is a list of the available addons:

- Calendar
- Insider
- Media
- Share Graph
- ShareHolder
- Share Calculator
- Subscription

= Looking for help =

I am currently in the search for someone who would like to help me with something of the following:

- Create a dashboard icon which can be used in the admin menu.
- Create a banner that would be displayed on the plugins homepage at wordpress.org.
- Design a nicer and more intuitive admin interface.
- Create a solid looking icon that can be used on multiple places.

If you would like to help with anything of the above, please do not hesitate and contact me either on slack or by email.

= Developers =

I am looking for developers that would be interested in contributing to either the free or premium version of the plugin.

Would be great just to get some ideas and input from others who have some experience in Wordpress plugin development.

At this point I am pretty much on my own, which will sometimes result in me just thinking around some issues in my own way; here I think it would be awesome to have others to talk to and collaborate.

If you think this sounds interesting, please drop me an email or ping me on Slack.

= Widget =

You can display a feed in any sidebar by adding and configure a widget.

You can either use the name of the template as given in the template header e.g 'Foo' or the actual filename e.g foo.php.

- flush

Here is an example using all of the above attributes:

`[cision-block id=example_block source_uid=A275C0BF733048FFAE9126ACA64DD08F language=sv date_format=m-d-Y readmore="Read more" show_excerpt=0 view=1 count=6 items_per_page=2 tags="cision,company" categories="New Year,Summer camp" types="PRM, RDV" start=2016-01-12 end=2019-06-12 image_style=UrlTo400x400ArResized mark_regulatory=1 regulatory_text=Regulatory non_regulatory_text=*none* show_filters=1 filter_all_text=*none* filter_regulatory_text=Regulatory filter_non_regulatory_text=Non-regulatory template=foo.php flush=true]`

**Notice** that all shortcode attributes are optional and that they **must** be on a single line.
Default values is taken from the plugins settings page.

Here is a complete list of the different kind of pressreleases:

* KMK - Annual Financial statement
* RDV - Annual Report
* PRM - Company Announcement
* RPT - Interim Report
* INB - Invitation
* NBR - Newsletter

= More than one block in a page =

To use more than one block in a single page you will need to set a unique id for each block or else they will both share the same cache entry.

= Filter and marking feed items =

On the 'Filters' tab you can enable filtering on you feed and add a text for the different kind of filters or use the default ones.
If for some reason you would like to hide a specific filter button you can enter the special value `*none*` in the corresponding text field.

You can add a text for each feed item stating if it is regulatory or not by checking the 'Mark regulatory' checkbox in the settings page.
If you wish to hide the text for regulatory or non-regulatory releases you can use the special value `*none*` in the corresponding text field.

= Template =

The template used to render the feed is **cision-block/templates/cision-block.php**, you can override
this template by copying it to either the root or under a **templates** folder in your theme.

You can also select a specific template which will be used to render the feed under the plugins settings page.
To create a new template, you can follow the steps as described in this link: [Page Templates](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/template-files-section/page-template-files/):

For instance adding a file with the following header comment would create a new 'Foo' template:

    <?php
    /**
     * Template name: Foo
     * Template Post Type: cision-block-post
     *
     * Template used to display a feed from Cision.
     **/
    ?>

= Display single press releases in Wordpress =

Since version 2.0.0 it is possible to fetch and display press releases directly from within Wordpress.
The template used in this case is **cision-block/templates/cision-block-post.php**, you can override
this template by copying it to either the root or under a **templates** folder in your theme.

The `$CisionItem` feed object that is available in the template contains all raw data fetched from Cision.
Under the **Resources** section there is a link that explains all the different fields that is available.
For example if you use the `$CisionItem->HtmlBody` to display content from the feed item you might have to add custom
css since this contains pre formated html which may include inline css and so on.

= Fields =

By default only the following fields are collected for each feed item:

* Title
* Intro
* Body
* PublishDate
* CisionWireUrl
* IsRegulatory
* Images[0]
 * DownloadUrl
 * Description

= Filters =

Add more fields to each feed item:

    add_filter('cision_map_source_item', function($item, $data, $block_id) {
      $item['Header'] = sanitize_text_field($data->Header);
      $item['LogoUrl'] = esc_url_raw($data->LogoUrl);
      $item['SocialMediaPitch'] = sanitize_text_field($data->SocialMediaPitch);

      return $item;
    }, 10, 3);

Customize the sorting of the feed items:

    add_filter('cision_block_sort', function($items, $block_id) {
      usort($items, function($a, $b) {
        return $a->PublishDate > $b->PublishDate;
      });

      return $items;
    }, 10, 2);

Add custom attributes to the pager:

    add_filter('cision_block_pager_attributes', function(array $attributes, $block_id) {
      return array_merge(
        $attributes,
        array(
          'class' => 'custom-class',
          'id' => 'custom-id',
        )
      );
    }, 10, 2);

Set a custom class for active pager item:

    add_filter('cision_block_pager_active_class', function($class, $block_id) {
      return 'custom-class';
    }, 10, 2);

To add attributes to the section wrapper in the template:

    add_filter('cision_block_wrapper_attributes', function(array $attributes, $block_id) {
      return array(
        'class' => array(
          'custom-class',
        ),
      );
    }, 10, 2);

To add attributes to the article wrapper in the template:

    add_filter('cision_block_media_attributes', function(array $attributes, $block_id) {
      return array(
        'class' => array(
          'custom-class',
        ),
      );
    }, 10, 2);

Add a prefix that will be displayed at the start of the wrapper:

    add_filter('cision_block_prefix', function($prefix, $block_id) {
      return '<h1>Prefix</h1>';
    }, 10, 2);

Add a suffix that will be displayed at the end of the wrapper:

    add_filter('cision_block_suffix', function($suffix, $block_id) {
      return '<h1>Suffix</h1>';
    }, 10, 2);

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I get the Premium version? =

You can contact me by sending on an email to: [cisionblock@gmail.com](mailto:cisionblock@gmail.com).

= Can I fetch more than the last 100 news? =

You will need to use the **Pro** version to do this.

= How do I get a unique feed identifier? =

This is something that Cision will provide you with.
You can contact them at support@cision.com.

= Possible to have more than 1 identifier? =

There is possible to use separate feed identifiers for different blocks by using the
**source_uid** attribute in the shortcode as in this example:

    [cision-block source_uid=A275C0BF733048FFAE9126ACA64DD08F]

= Possible to create multiple cision blocks? =

Yes it is possible to have multiple blocks by simply adding shortcode arguments for each block.
